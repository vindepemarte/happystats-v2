### 2024-11-08: CRITICAL LESSON LEARNED - Date Formatting Bug Resolution

#### ❌ MISTAKES TO NEVER REPEAT:
1. **Assuming the problem without proper investigation**: Initially thought the issue was in the `formatDate` function itself, wasted time modifying it without understanding the root cause
2. **Not tracing the data flow completely**: Failed to follow the data from database → API → frontend to identify where the corruption was happening
3. **Making superficial fixes**: Added error handling and warnings without fixing the actual source of empty objects `{}`
4. **Not testing the actual serialization process**: Should have tested JSON.stringify behavior with Date objects immediately
5. **Creating unnecessary test files**: Wasted time creating test files instead of debugging the actual application flow

#### ✅ WHAT ACTUALLY WORKED - THE REAL SOLUTION:
**Root Cause**: The `toCamelCase` function in `src/lib/database.ts` was recursively processing Date objects, corrupting them into empty objects `{}` during serialization.

**Actual Fixes Applied**:
1. **Fixed `toCamelCase` function**: Added special handling for Date objects to prevent recursive processing:
   ```typescript
   // Handle Date objects specially - don't recurse into them
   if (obj instanceof Date) {
     return obj;
   }
   ```

2. **Enhanced date serialization**: Created `serializeDatesForJSON` helper function and applied it to ALL API endpoints:
   - `src/app/api/charts/route.ts`
   - `src/app/api/charts/[id]/route.ts`
   - `src/app/api/charts/[id]/data-points/route.ts`
   - `src/app/api/data-points/[id]/route.ts`
   - `src/app/api/charts/import/route.ts`

3. **Proper API response serialization**: Ensured all Date objects are converted to ISO strings before JSON serialization

#### 🎯 DEBUGGING METHODOLOGY THAT WORKED:
1. **Trace the data flow**: Database → Model → API → Frontend
2. **Test raw database queries**: Verified database returns proper Date objects
3. **Test JSON serialization**: Confirmed Date objects serialize correctly to ISO strings
4. **Identify the corruption point**: Found `toCamelCase` was corrupting Date objects
5. **Fix at the source**: Modified the function causing the issue, not just the symptoms

#### 🚨 CRITICAL RULES FOR FUTURE DEBUGGING:
1. **ALWAYS trace the complete data flow first**
2. **Test each step of the pipeline individually**
3. **Fix the root cause, not the symptoms**
4. **Don't assume - verify with actual data**
5. **When dealing with serialization issues, test JSON.stringify behavior immediately**

**Result**: ✅ No more "formatDate received unexpected type: object – {}" warnings, proper date display throughout the application.
